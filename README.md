# video-transcribe-app

To build a web app that transcribes text displayed in a video of a chatbot interaction, you would need to follow these steps:
Video Processing: Implement a feature to upload and process video files. Use a library like OpenCV for Python to capture frames from the video.
Text Recognition (OCR): Apply Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to the captured frames to extract text. Libraries like Pytesseract, which is a wrapper for Google's Tesseract-OCR Engine, can be used for this purpose.
Text Aggregation: Develop logic to aggregate and order the extracted text based on the timestamp of the frames to maintain the flow of the conversation.
Web Interface: Create a user-friendly web interface that allows users to upload videos and view the transcribed text. Use a web framework like Flask or Django for the backend, and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend.
Testing: Test the application thoroughly to ensure it accurately transcribes text from various video qualities and formats.
Deployment: Deploy the web app on a server or cloud platform to make it accessible to users.

i understand your limitations, i want you to provide complete hypothetical code by simulating what you need to
